  # DEPLOYMENT DISABLED: Azure Web App configuration needs to be verified
  # The deployment is currently failing with DNS lookup errors (ENOTFOUND emmanuel-ffarbchuewgze4gk.scm.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net)
  # This indicates the Azure Web App name or publish profile may be incorrect.
  #
  # To re-enable deployment:
  # 1. Verify the correct Azure Web App name in your Azure Portal
  # 2. Download the correct publish profile from Azure (Settings > Download publish profile)
  # 3. Update the AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE_FADC2CBCEAAF4EE99BBB7C8520B013AF secret with the correct publish profile
  # 4. Update the 'app-name' parameter below to match your actual Azure Web App name
  # 5. Change "if: false" to "if: true" or remove the if condition entirely
